## Summary

### Suggestion

We discussed about dubbo-go's problems and what we will do in next month.

1. dubbo-go try the best to keep compitable with Dubbo. And we will try to
implement some new features, like supporting XDS;
2. supporting service mesh will be suspended until we actually need this
feature;
3. No hurry to pulish dubbo-go v1.5. Quality is the most important thing.
4. Find more users and collect the feebacks. Now some users are lack
of enthusiasm to participate in community discussion.
5. We should pay more attention to improve performance, quality.
6. Writing more documents, comments and samples.

### Future Plan

The plan for v1.5.x:

1. 1.5.x will focus on bug fix, code optimization;
2. Writing user document;
3. Everyone should write the documents, and then one person will be
responsible to collate those documents;
4. Writing comments for existed codes;
5. Improve the quality of samples;
